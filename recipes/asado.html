    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. It literally translates to "grilled meat," so the steak is traditionally grilled.</p>
    <p>This carne asada marinade is packed with delicious ingredients, like:</p>

    <p><strong>Fruit Juice</strong></p>
    Orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice add fruity flavor to this marinade. 

    <p><strong>Soy Sauce</strong></p>
    Soy sauce lends a rich, savory flavor to the steak. 
    
    <p><strong>Seasonings and Spices</strong></p>
    This marinade includes cilantro, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, pepper, and oregano. 
    
    <p><strong>Olive Oil</strong></p>
    Olive oil keeps the steak moist and helps to lock in the flavors.

        <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Carne Asada:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds flank steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.</li>
        <li>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
